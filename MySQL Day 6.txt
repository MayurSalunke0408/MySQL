/*What is a SQL Stored Procedure?
The stored procedure is a prepared SQL query that you can save so that the query can be reused over
and over again. So, if the user has an SQL query that you write over and over again, keep it as a stored
procedure and execute it. Users can also pass parameters to a stored procedure so that the stored
procedure can act based on the parameter value that is given.

/*  Trigger is a stored program that invoked automatically in response to an event such as insert, delete or
update that occurs in the table. Suppose, you defined a trigger and you insert a row inside the table,
then it will automatically invoked before or after the insertion of row.
There are two types of the TRIGGERS:
1. Row-level-Triggers: it is activated for each row that is inserted, deleted or updated.
2. Statement-level-Triggers: it is executed for each transaction.
